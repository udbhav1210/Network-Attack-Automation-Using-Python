This project involves the creation of a Python script named net_attack.py, designed to automate the process of discovering weak usernames and passwords commonly used in network services like HTTP and SSH. The script allows users to perform reconnaissance by targeting specific IP addresses and ports, and it includes features for active brute-forcing of credentials. The script extends to post-exploitation scenarios, where the user is given the option to interact with a target through an interactive shell or spawn a persistent shell using an additional script named shell.py. This reverse shell script connects back to the user and supports custom commands to automate tasks like gathering system and network information. Communication between net_attack.py and shell.py is obfuscated or encrypted to ensure confidentiality during the interaction. The scripts in this project have been written as per university guidelines and is intended solely for educational purpose. It must only be used in controlled environments such as a lab. Any malicious use of the script is discouraged and condoned.
